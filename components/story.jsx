                    You were born in a world full of ducks<br />
                    You were an innocent and kind child<br />
                    You studied at the school and grew up<br /> 
                    Then you graduated from college and stepped into this society<br />
                </p>

                <p className="font-roboto text-left text-xs md:text-xl pt-4 md:pt-10 w-5/6 lg:w-1/3">
                    But you gradually noticed that you are a little different from others<br />
                    Your neck was a little too long<br />
                    Your pace was a little too slow<br />
                    Your voice was too loud<br />
                    Your words were too straightforward<br />
                    You found out that you seem to be a Goose<br />
                    They started to reject you<br />
                </p>

                <p className="font-roboto text-left text-xs md:text-xl pt-4 md:pt-10 w-5/6 lg:w-1/3">
                    So you tried to fit into the group<br />
                    You dyed your white feathers brown and your hair green<br />
                    You were on a diet, trying to get your body shape similar to theirs<br />
                    You tried to pick up your pace and keep up with the rhythm of this society<br />
                    You started to present euphemistically<br />
                    You finally became part of them<br />
                    All the ducks around you like you<br />
                    Now your identity is a duck<br />
                    You turned into a duck<br />
                </p>

                <p className="font-roboto text-left text-xs md:text-xl pt-4 md:pt-10 w-5/6 lg:w-1/3">
                    But<br />
                    With my best wishes to all of you<br />
                    Lay back and take off your camouflage<br />
                    Face your actual self<br />
                    There's nothing wrong with being yourself<br />
                    Chill Man! Keep it real<br />
